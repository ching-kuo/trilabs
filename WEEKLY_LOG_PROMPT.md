## What Kai does with your data

1. Copies `.training-log-template` → `training-log-YYYY-WNN`
2. Writes the post in English (primary), then zh-TW and JA versions
3. Sets `draft: false` when ready for review
4. Opens a PR for your approval before publishing

---

## Tips

- **Be honest** — the struggle sections make for the best reading
- **RANDOM_THOUGHT_OR_STORY** is optional but gold. Even one sentence is fine.
- You can send Garmin/Strava screenshots instead of filling numbers manually
- If you missed a week, just skip it — no need to back-fill
