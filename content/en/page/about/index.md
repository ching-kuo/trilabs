Hi, I am Ching Kuo — a triathlete and cloud infrastructure engineer based in Tokyo, Japan. Originally from Taiwan.

I am chasing a Kona qualification while working in cloud infrastructure (Kubernetes, OpenStack) by day.

This blog is where I document the journey: training, racing, and everything in between.

**Goals:**
- Sub-10 hour Ironman (2027)
- Kona qualification (within 5 years)
